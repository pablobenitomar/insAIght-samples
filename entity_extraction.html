        Paris, the City of Light, has been a cultural and historical hub for centuries. Founded in the 3rd century BC by the Parisii, the city has played a crucial role in European history. One of its most famous landmarks is the Eiffel Tower, designed by Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle. Another iconic site is the Louvre Museum, home to masterpieces like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.
        Walking along the Champs-Élysées, visitors arrive at the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 to honor the French army. The city’s intellectual legacy is immense, with figures like Victor Hugo, who wrote Les Misérables, and Jean-Paul Sartre, a leading existentialist philosopher.
        Paris is also a political center, housing the Élysée Palace, the official residence of the President of France. The city has witnessed pivotal moments, such as the French Revolution in 1789, when the Bastille was stormed, marking the end of absolute monarchy.
        In modern times, organizations like UNESCO, headquartered in Paris since 1945, work towards global cultural preservation. The city remains a global fashion capital, with brands like Chanel, founded by Coco Chanel, shaping haute couture.
        Every year, millions visit for events like Paris Fashion Week, held twice annually. The city’s charm extends to its cafés, such as Café de Flore, where Simone de Beauvoir and Sartre debated philosophy. From historical revolutions to contemporary elegance, Paris continues to captivate the world.
